The program for the 6th homework works like this:

FUNCTION Buildings:

This function creates the blueprint for a "correct" list for all the    values from a txt file, in this order:

1. width 
2. height
3. intensity of R color channel 
4. intensity of G color channel
5. intensity of B color channel
The last three stored in a tuple.
This function is essential for the followings, which exploit this data order

FUNCTION MinWidth:
This function finds the minimum width for the photo in which the building are drawn, using the widths of the buildings and the spacing

FUNCTION MakeMapRow:
This functions finds all the starting points for every shape in the picture, along with the specific spacing needed between the various buildings
Here, the "single building" case is accounted for, computing different starting coordinates for it

FUNCTION ReadFile:
This function takes the data file, opens it and calls the first function to return the correct version
FUNCTION MakeMapMatrix:
This function finds the middle of each row to align every building
This is done by finding the tallest building first in order to take its halved height as a row center

FUNCTION DrawRect:
This function, taking the image and shape details, draws said shapes pixel by pixel

FUNCTION MakeMapImage:
This function creates the background after minimal dimensions are found
It then calls DrawRect to draw every shape and returns the edited image

FUNCTION ex:
Given that fact that we have so many functions, the ex is pretty simple
Dimensions of the image and starting points of the shapes are found, the image is then drawn and saved
Finally, dimensions are returned
