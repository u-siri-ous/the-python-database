The program based on "who screams louder" works in this way:

1) It starts by removing spaces and tabs on a copy of the sequences
2) It substitutes every player character with equivalent UNICODE values
3) Then it makes all players challenge once:
	In the match, difference between values is calculated
	Points are assigned according to the rules
	In case of a tie, the challengers' values sum is computed (if not done already) and compared 
	In case of a further tie, it follows the lexicographic order rules
4) It returns the ranking of players at the end
